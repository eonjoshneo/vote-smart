<p><u>HOW TO AVOID ELECTION MISINFORMATION AND PROPAGANDA</u> </p>
<ul>Be Careful with What You Believe and Share Online
Social media is full of false information, tricks, and edited photos or videos meant to fool people. Many of these are made to change how people think, especially about elections.</ul>  

Our page will help you avoid falling for false information so you can choose the best leader for a better future.  
 
How False Information Spreads
<ol>
Today, any news big or small can spread fast. It happens like this:  
<li>Someone posts something online.  </li>
<li>Their followers share it on their own pages.  </li>
<li>More people talk about it, making it seem important, even if it’s not true.  </li>
</ol>

This cycle keeps going, making lies spread quickly. While you can’t stop it, you can avoid adding to the problem.  </p>

<ul>How to Protect Yourself
<li>The best way to stay safe from false information is to think before you share. If a post makes you angry or strongly agrees with what you already believe, stop and check if it’s true first. Scammers and fake news creators know how to trick people by telling them what they want to hear. </li></ul> 

<p>Also, be aware that news companies need to make money. They try to be accurate, but many focus on stories that their audience wants to hear, which can make them biased.  </p>

<p>Be Careful with Emotional Stories
Stories that make you feel strong emotions
like hope, fear, or anger can be powerful. They can inspire people to vote, but they can also be used to mislead them. Instead of believing them right away, take a step back and think. </p> 

<p>Before you vote, make sure your decision is based on facts, not just feelings.</p>
