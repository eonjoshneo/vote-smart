<p><u>You're the voice: it's our responsibility to vote wisely </u>



<ul>Not every choice is made equally.  Some have insignificant repercussions.  Some are more important, such as if you choose to put your profession before seeing the entire world.  These choices, however, still only have an effect on your life and are unlikely to have an effect on others.</ul>

<u>Tips on how to vote wisely</u>
<li>#1- Know everything about each candidate 
Whether they are running for national or local position, it’s very important that we know everything about each candidate. Spend time learning about the backgrounds of other candidates as well as their specific plans for the nation when they are elected, rather than concentrating just on one.</li>

<li>#2- Listen with an open mind
Politicians invest money just to learn public speaking and how to deal with different kinds of voters. Like salespeople, they are attractive and have a lovely voice.  Therefore, be wary of their good intentions, particularly if they seem too good to be true.  Rather, pay attention to them with an open mind.  Sometimes, wise politicians use language that is not to be taken literally.</li>

 <ol>#3- Never vote based on popularity
Unfortunately, this is a big issue for those who are too lazy or lack the time to research each candidate in depth.  Indeed, wealthy candidates are exploiting this voter weakness.  A lot of politicians come from show business, so keep in mind that they are also actors.</ol>

<li>#4- Don’t just join the majority vote
Many politicians tend to ask support from big groups so they can instantly get majority votes. The issue is that you are denying yourself the freedom to make your own decisions.  It's perfectly acceptable to listen to suggestions, but don't support a candidate just because you think a lot of people would support him.  Simply said, don't let anyone tell you what to do.</li>

<li>#5- Vote what our country needs, not who you need Politicians pretend that they genuinely care about the underprivileged.  Actually, many of them conduct favors for wealthy businessmen or donate items and cash to low-income families.  If you truly need their presents, it's acceptable to take them, but it doesn't imply you should vote for them.  This "utang na loob" mentality must end, and we must finally vote for what our nation truly needs.</li></ol>
